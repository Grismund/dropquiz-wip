DropQuiz is a teaching resource which empowers teachers of all skill levels to create rigorous and aligned questions from any text on earth.

## The Feels

Here are some aspirational statements I'd like teachers to say while using DropQuiz

- "DropQuiz is my secret weapon for test questions."
- "It saves me so much time!"
- "It helps me come up with better questions faster."
- "I'm confident that I can provide good questions for my kids."
- "I have a special edge on my cowerkers, and I can't wait to share it!"
- "My principal will be impressed with my tests and quizzes."

## Current State

## Phase I Goals

Phase I should be a simple design to demo to schools.
- Able to build quickly (static single page or page with carousel)
- Creates a good visual first impression.

Good Designs
- [NewsELA](https://newsela.com/) I like the simplicity of the design and how professional or non-scammy it feels compared to a lot of other educational sites.
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) I also really like this design. This site might be considered a tpye of competitor, but all quizzes are user generated, so you never know what you'll get.
  - Quizlet has general-purpose ai tools for generating flash cards and term/definition tests from any text. They are not state-standard, grade level, or Bloom's aligned. But it's great to see how they handle communicating disclaimers about ai, how they handle long response times from the ai, and how they guide the user through the exprience (not great), but the design is solid as well.
